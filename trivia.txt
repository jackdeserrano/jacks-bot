To die—to sleep, / No more; and by a sleep to say we end / The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks / That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation / Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; / To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: / For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, / When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, / Must give us pause—there's the respect / That makes calamity of so long life. / For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, / Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, / The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, / The insolence of office, and the spurns / That patient merit of th'unworthy takes, / When he himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, / To grunt and sweat under a weary life, / But that the dread of something after death, / The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn / No traveller returns, puzzles the will, / And makes us rather bear those ills we have / Than fly to others that we know not of? / Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, / And thus the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, / And enterprises of great pith and moment / With this regard their currents turn awry / And lose the name of action.
